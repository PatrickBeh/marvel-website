            <h2>Deadpool</h2>
            <p>
              Whose real name is Wade Winston Wilson, is a disfigured mercenary
              with the superhuman ability of regeneration and physical prowess.
              The character is known as the "Merc with a Mouth" because of his
              tendency to talk and joke constantly, including breaking the
              fourth wall for humorous effect and running gags. The character's
              popularity has seen him featured in numerous forms of other media.
              In the 2004 series Cable & Deadpool, he refers to his own scarred
              appearance as "Ryan Renolds crossed with a Shar-Pei" (Ryan
              Reynolds' name misspelled). Reynolds himself would eventually
              portray the character in the X-Men film series, appearing in X-Men
              Origins: Wolverine (2009), Deadpool (2016), and its sequel
              Deadpool 2 (2018). Reynolds attributes Cable & Deadpool #2 to what
              got him hooked on the character and inspired him to bring the
              character to the movies. He is confirmed to continue playing the
              character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
