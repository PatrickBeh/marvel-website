                Deadpool is a fictional character appearing in American comic
                books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Fabian
                Nicieza and artist/writer Rob Liefeld, the character first
                appeared in The New Mutants #98 (cover-dated February 1991).
                Initially, Deadpool was depicted as a supervillain when he made
                his first appearance in The New Mutants and later in issues of
                X-Force, but later evolved into his more recognizable antiheroic
                persona. <a href="pages/deadpool.html">Click here</a> for more

                Comic-book character who was the original everyman superhero. In
                Spider-Man’s first story, in Marvel Comics’ Amazing Fantasy, no.
                15 (1962), American teenager Peter Parker, a poor sickly orphan,
                is bitten by a radioactive spider. As a result of the bite, he
                gains superhuman strength, speed, and agility along with the
                ability to cling to walls. Writer Stan Lee and illustrator Steve
                Ditko created Spider-Man as a filler story for a canceled
                anthology series. At the time, a teenage lead hero was unheard
                of in comic books. However, young readers responded powerfully
                to Peter Parker, prompting an ongoing title and, ultimately, a
                media empire, including video games, several animated and one
                live-action television series, a live-action film franchise, and
                a Broadway musical.
